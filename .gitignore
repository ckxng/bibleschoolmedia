# Files which match the splat patterns below will
# be ignored by git.  This keeps random crap and
# and sensitive credentials from being uploaded to 
# your repository.  It allows you to configure your
# app for your machine without accidentally
# committing settings which will smash the local 
# settings of  other developers on your team. 
#
# Some reasonable defaults are included below,
# but, of course, you should modify/extend/prune
# to fit your needs!
