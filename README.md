# BibleSchool.Media

This Go/Angular project is open-source for the benefit of the community.

The goal of this project is to provide a free option for adults to teach 
children Bible stories in-person with the assistance of multimedia.

## Status

This project is somewhat functional and is capable of hosting lessons using 
Google AppEngine.  A number of improvements are needed before this software 
is ready for prime-time.  See this issues list for details.
